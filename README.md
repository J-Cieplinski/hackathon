## Coders School Hackathon Project
# ARKANOID
Arkanoid is a 1986 block breaker arcade game developed and published by Taito.
We decided to recreate this game for Coders School Hackathon. It was created using C++ and SFML (https://www.sfml-dev.org).

You don't have to include anything more, since we included all of the necessary materials inside repository.

Game is prepared to use 1280x720px resolution, if you don't have such a display feel free to edit windowWidth and windowHeight in Headers.hpp file (both values are in px).
